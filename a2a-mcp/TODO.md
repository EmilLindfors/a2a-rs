# A2A-RMCP Integration TODO List

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Research and understand both A2A and RMCP protocols
- [x] Design the overall architecture for the integration
- [x] Set up initial crate structure with Cargo.toml and dependencies
- [x] Create minimal demo example showing how the protocol translation would work
- [x] Develop conceptual structure for core components:
  - [x] Error handling system
  - [x] Message conversion between formats
  - [x] Tool-to-agent adapter design
  - [x] Agent-to-tool adapter design
  - [x] Server adapter design
  - [x] Client adapter design
- [x] Document the translation approach between the protocols
- [x] Set up basic testing structure

## Next Steps

### Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement robust error handling system
- [ ] Implement message converter for bidirectional translation
- [ ] Implement tool-to-agent adapter
- [ ] Implement agent-to-tool adapter
- [ ] Implement server interface for exposing RMCP tools as A2A agents
- [ ] Implement client interface for using A2A agents as RMCP tools

### Transport Layer
- [ ] Implement RMCP to A2A transport adapter
- [ ] Implement A2A to RMCP transport adapter
- [ ] Add support for different transport types (HTTP, WebSocket)

### Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for all components
- [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end flows
- [ ] Create example applications:
  - [ ] RMCP server exposing tools as A2A agent
  - [ ] A2A agents being used as RMCP tools
- [ ] Add detailed API documentation with examples
- [ ] Create user guide with usage patterns

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add streaming support for real-time updates
- [ ] Implement authentication adapter for cross-protocol security
- [ ] Add support for file/binary data transfer
- [ ] Optimize performance for large message payloads
- [ ] Add telemetry and monitoring capabilities

## Implementation Notes

- The integration should maintain the distinct advantages of each protocol
- Need to handle task lifecycle states properly when mapping to RMCP's simpler model
- Authentication schemes need careful mapping between protocols
- Both protocols use JSON-RPC as their base, which simplifies some aspects of integration
