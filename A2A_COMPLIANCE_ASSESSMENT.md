# A2A Specification Compliance Assessment

## Overview

This document provides an assessment of the a2a-rs codebase against the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol specification.

## Compliance Assessment

Overall, the current implementation mostly follows the A2A specification with a few gaps and areas for improvement.

### What's Implemented Correctly:
1. The JSON-RPC message formats match the specification
2. The domain models properly define the required fields and structures
3. Error handling is set up correctly with proper error codes
4. Both HTTP and WebSocket transports are implemented
5. Core endpoints (send task, get task, cancel task, push notifications) are properly implemented

### Implementation Gaps:

1. **Task History**: While the Task structure includes the history field, the implementation in the task_storage doesn't seem to fully implement state transition history tracking and handling history_length parameters.

2. **Skills in AgentCard**: The implementation of the AgentCard requires skills, but there's no logic for handling or using skills in the code yet.

3. **File Content Validation**: The FileContent structure requires either bytes or URI but not both, and there's validation in the model, but it's not clearly enforced in all places where this type is used.

4. **Push Notifications**: While the push notification infrastructure is in place, the actual sending of notifications to external URLs isn't fully implemented.

5. **Agent Authentication**: The authentication models are defined, but the implementation doesn't fully utilize the authentication schemes in all places.

### Suggested Improvements:

1. **Complete Task History Implementation**: Enhance the task storage to properly track state transition history and respect the history_length parameter when returning tasks.

2. **Implement Skills Handling**: Add methods to handle agent skills in the AgentInfoProvider and expose them properly through the API.

3. **Enforce File Content Validation**: Ensure that the FileContent validation is applied consistently across all usage points.

4. **Implement Push Notification Sender**: Add a component that actually sends push notifications to external URLs when task updates occur.

5. **Add Authentication Middleware**: Implement proper authentication middleware for the HTTP and WebSocket servers that validate incoming credentials against the configured authentication schemes.

6. **Add Tests**: Create comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify specification compliance, particularly around edge cases.

7. **Improve Error Handling**: Add more detailed error responses that provide specific context about what went wrong, especially for validation errors.

8. **API Documentation**: Generate API documentation that specifically references the A2A spec to make it easier for users to understand how the implementation maps to the spec.
