  - Current structure mixes transport concerns with business logic
  - Goal: Clear separation between transport protocols, business capabilities, and storage
  
- [x] **Create new adapter structure**
  ```
  adapter/
  ├── transport/           # Transport protocol implementations
  │   ├── http/
  │   │   ├── client.rs   # HTTP client (implements AsyncA2AClient)
  │   │   └── server.rs   # HTTP server (uses business capability ports)
  │   └── websocket/
  │       ├── client.rs   # WebSocket client (implements AsyncA2AClient)
  │       └── server.rs   # WebSocket server (uses business capability ports)
  ├── business/           # Business capability implementations
  │   ├── agent_info.rs          # SimpleAgentInfo implementation
  │   ├── default_handler.rs     # DefaultBusinessHandler - implements all business ports
  │   ├── request_processor.rs   # DefaultRequestProcessor using business ports
  │   └── mod.rs
  ├── storage/            # Storage implementations
  │   └── task_storage.rs # InMemoryTaskStorage, etc.
  ├── auth/              # Authentication implementations
  │   ├── authenticator.rs
  │   └── push_notification.rs
  └── error/             # Error types
      ├── client.rs
      └── server.rs
  ```

- [x] **Migration Steps**
  1. [x] Create new directory structure
  2. [x] Move HTTP client from `client/http.rs` to `transport/http/client.rs`
  3. [x] Move HTTP server from `server/http.rs` to `transport/http/server.rs`
  4. [x] Move WebSocket client from `client/ws.rs` to `transport/websocket/client.rs`
  5. [x] Move WebSocket server from `server/ws.rs` to `transport/websocket/server.rs`
  6. [x] Extract business logic from `server/request_processor.rs` to `business/` modules
  7. [x] Move `server/task_storage.rs` to `storage/task_storage.rs`
  8. [x] Move authentication from `server/auth.rs` to `auth/authenticator.rs`
