# A2A-RS Improvement TODO

> **🎯 Current Status**: Phase 1 (Specification Compliance) COMPLETED ✅  
> **📋 Core Library**: All tests passing, specification-compliant  
> **🏗️ Next**: Ready for Phase 2 structural improvements  
> **📅 Last Updated**: December 2024

## Phase 1: Specification Compliance (High Priority) ✅ COMPLETED

### Critical Issues ✅
- [x] **Fix push notification method names** - Update from `pushNotification` to `pushNotificationConfig`
  - [x] Update `src/application/json_rpc.rs:295` - method name in SetTaskPushNotificationRequest
  - [x] Update `src/application/json_rpc.rs:328` - method name in GetTaskPushNotificationRequest
  - [x] Update JSON-RPC deserializer to handle new method names
  - [x] Fix broken tests and ensure library tests pass

### Legacy Method Cleanup 🟡
- [ ] **Remove or deprecate legacy methods** (Lower priority - still functional)
  - [ ] Mark `tasks/send` as deprecated in favor of `message/send`
  - [ ] Mark `tasks/sendSubscribe` as deprecated in favor of `message/stream`
  - [ ] Add migration documentation for users

### Specification Validation ✅
- [x] **Ensure all required spec fields are present**
  - [x] Validate AgentCard required fields match spec exactly
  - [x] Validate Message structure alignment
  - [x] Validate Task structure alignment
  - [x] Cross-reference with specification.json schema
  - [x] All core library tests now pass

## Phase 2: Structural Improvements (Medium Priority) 🟡

### Domain Layer Enhancement
- [ ] **Reorganize domain layer structure**
  ```
  src/domain/
  ├── core/           # Essential types (Agent, Message, Task)
  ├── events/         # Streaming events (TaskStatusUpdateEvent, TaskArtifactUpdateEvent)
  ├── protocols/      # Protocol-specific types (JSON-RPC, A2A extensions)
  └── validation/     # Cross-cutting validation logic
  ```
  - [ ] Move core types to `src/domain/core/`
  - [ ] Create `src/domain/events/` for streaming events
  - [ ] Create `src/domain/protocols/` for protocol types
  - [ ] Create `src/domain/validation/` for validation logic

### Builder Pattern Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add `bon` crate to dependencies**
- [x] **Implement comprehensive builders for complex types**
  - [x] AgentCard builder foundation added
  - [x] Message builder with full validation and smart defaults
  - [x] Task builder with proper defaults and validation
  - [x] Part builders (PartBuilder, FilePartBuilder) with fluent API
  - [x] Built-in validation methods for all builder-created objects
  - [x] Type-safe compile-time guarantees for required fields
  - [x] Example demonstrating all builder patterns (`examples/builder_patterns.rs`)
  - [ ] SecurityScheme builders for each variant (future enhancement)

### Error Structure Enhancement
- [ ] **Improve error types with more context**
  - [ ] Add structured validation errors with field-level details
  - [ ] Add error suggestions for common mistakes
  - [ ] Implement better error chaining
  - [ ] Add error recovery hints

### Application Layer Restructuring
- [ ] **Split large json_rpc.rs file (614 lines)**
  - [ ] Create `src/application/handlers/message.rs`
  - [ ] Create `src/application/handlers/task.rs`
  - [ ] Create `src/application/handlers/notification.rs`
  - [ ] Update module re-exports

### Enhanced Port Definitions
- [ ] **Create more granular port traits**
  - [ ] MessageHandler trait for message processing
  - [ ] TaskManager trait for task operations
  - [ ] NotificationManager trait for push notifications
  - [ ] StreamingHandler trait for real-time updates

## Phase 3: Enhanced Developer Experience (Low Priority) 🟢

### Observability & Logging
- [ ] **Add structured logging with tracing**
  - [ ] Add tracing dependency
  - [ ] Instrument key functions with #[instrument]
  - [ ] Add contextual logging for debugging
  - [ ] Add performance metrics collection

### Configuration Management
- [ ] **Implement comprehensive configuration system**
  - [ ] Create A2AConfig with builder pattern
  - [ ] Add environment-specific config examples
  - [ ] Add configuration validation
  - [ ] Add config file support (TOML/YAML)

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] **Expand testing coverage**
  - [ ] Add property-based tests for protocol compliance
  - [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
  - [ ] Add performance benchmarks for streaming
  - [ ] Add fuzz testing for message parsing

### Documentation Improvements
- [ ] **Enhance API documentation**
  - [ ] Add comprehensive examples to lib.rs
  - [ ] Document common usage patterns
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
  - [ ] Create migration guide for breaking changes
  - [ ] Add architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Identify and fix performance bottlenecks**
  - [ ] Profile message serialization/deserialization
  - [ ] Optimize streaming performance
  - [ ] Add connection pooling for clients
  - [ ] Implement efficient task storage patterns

## 🚨 Outstanding Issues (Medium Priority)

### Examples and Integration Tests
- [ ] **Fix compilation errors in examples** (Lower priority - core library works)
  - [ ] Update `examples/http_client.rs` - Message::user_text() missing message_id parameter
  - [ ] Update `examples/websocket_client.rs` - Message creation and event field access
  - [ ] Update `examples/websocket_server.rs` - AgentCard creation method signature
  - [ ] Update `examples/http_server.rs` - Task constructor requires context_id
  - [ ] Fix integration test failures in `tests/integration_test.rs`
  - [ ] Fix push notification test in `tests/push_notification_test.rs`

> **Note**: The core library is fully functional and specification-compliant. 
> Examples and integration tests need updating due to improved type safety and required fields,
> but these are not blocking for library usage.

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Future) 🔵

### Enhanced Security
- [ ] **Advanced authentication features**
  - [ ] Token refresh handling
  - [ ] Certificate-based authentication
  - [ ] Rate limiting and throttling
  - [ ] Audit logging for security events

### Monitoring & Metrics
- [ ] **Production monitoring capabilities**
  - [ ] Health check endpoints
  - [ ] Prometheus metrics export
  - [ ] Distributed tracing support
  - [ ] Performance dashboards

### Protocol Extensions
- [ ] **Support for future A2A protocol enhancements**
  - [ ] Plugin system for custom message types
  - [ ] Protocol versioning support
  - [ ] Backward compatibility layer
  - [ ] Forward compatibility checks

## Notes

- Maintain the hexagonal architecture - it's working well
- Focus on specification compliance first
- Don't break existing API unless absolutely necessary
- Add deprecation warnings before removing features
- Ensure all changes are backward compatible where possible
